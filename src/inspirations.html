              Ryan Holiday, beyond his acclaimed books, inspires me for his unconventional lifestyle. Despite his fame as an author, he thrives far from the city with his family, untouched by the pitfalls of success.Ryan in an interview once said about Marcus Aurelius

                <p class="quote-ins">
                He could basically do anything he wanted and had the known world at his fingertips. Instead he chose to try to live a life of virtue and honor, writing personal exhortations to himself at night a reminders of how to live a good life.

                <p class="inner-para-ins">The peom 'if' by Rudard Kipling in my opinion is the best ever written. This poem alone has inspired me to be a better person and hence I felt it necessary to list its poet as an inspiration. These are a few lines from 'if' </p>

                        If you can make one heap of all your winnings
                        And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
                        And lose, and start again at your beginnings
                        And never breathe a word about your loss.

                <h2 class="insp-name-ins">Seneca</h2>
                <p class="inner-para-ins"> Seneca a famous philospher once said "While I may wish to be free from the pangs of suffering and adversity, should the hour demand its presence, I am resolved to confront it with an unwavering spirit. I shall aspire not for its absence but for the strength to endure it with fortitude, to navigate through pain without surrendering my tranquility or causing harm to others." It is precisley because of this and many other sayings I find great value in his teachings.</p>

                <p class="inner-para-ins"> 
                    Despite having humble beginnings as a slave in anicient Rome, Epictitus became one of the greatest philosphers of all time. What makes him unique is his emphasis on the idea of focusing on what we can control and not letting things outside our control bother us. I belive this lesson is important for people of my generation including myself.Epictitus became one of the greatest philosphers of all time.</p>
